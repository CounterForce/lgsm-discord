# lgsm-discord
Discord bot to deploy on linux gsm csgo servers for remote management. https://linuxgsm.com/

Each server requires a new deploy.

## Configuration

You will need two config files, config.ini and servers.ini. Each file needs to be deployed with each bot on each lgsm machine and needs to contain all the information required on each server instance on each machine.

For example configs see config.sample.ini and servers.sample.ini.

## Usage (Example)

Kinda outdated still can be used for reference.
